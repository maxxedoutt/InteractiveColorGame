This is a color guessing game to improve your Hexcode rgb knowledge.

It gives you 2 modes and they are : Hard/easy.

Hard mode gives you 6 squares, and also display's a color code in hex on the top of it.

Your objective is to correctly guess the right square from the grid of 6 squares.

You can play as many times as you want to, and also change the color pattern as many times, if you are not comfortable with it.

Easy mode is very similar, except you are displayed a color grid of 3 squares.

Feel free to check out the game, and tell me if there are any changes to be done!!

Its a very satisfying game, do play it!
